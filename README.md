# Vaudoise API Guidelines
so called "Standards API"

## Purpose

In 2016 we discovered that consuming APIs at La Vaudoise was quite hard. Everybody was developing APIs in its own way. There was no common pratice and people were not using worldwide standards, such as the HTTP protocol, properly.

## Usage

If you speak french (or want to learn), you can access our [API Standards v1.1 (french version)](fr/introduction.md).
If you speak english, well... you have to wait. We did not translate them, yet.

## Contact

Shoot us an email at opensource@vaudoise.ch if you have questions.

Feel free to use these guidelines if needed.
